🧠 What is Django? (Very first idea)

Django is a Python web framework.

That means:

Python = the programming language

Web = websites (like Instagram, YouTube, school portals)

Framework = a toolbox + rules that help you build websites faster and safely



Django’s job

Django:

Receives the request

Decides what page to show

Talks to the database if needed

Sends HTML back to the browser


🧱 Django uses MVT (core concept)

Django is based on MVT:

Part	Meaning	What it does
M	Model	Database (data)
V	View	Logic (what happens)
T	Template	HTML (what user sees)

👉 Think:

Model = data

View = brain

Template = face

What are migrations?

Migrations are instructions Django uses to:

Create tables

Update tables

Track database changes


1. Model (Data Layer)

    Purpose: Manages the database structure and data logic.

    Key Task: Defines the data fields (like CharField, DateTimeField) and behaviors.

    Note: Django uses an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), so you can interact with your database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL.

2. View (Logic Layer)

    Purpose: The "brain" of the application.

    Key Task: Receives HTTP requests, fetches data from the Model, and sends it to the Template.

    Note: This is where your business logic lives (e.g., "only show posts if the user is logged in").

3. Template (Presentation Layer)

    Purpose: Handles the User Interface (UI).

    Key Task: Displays data to the user using HTML and DTL (Django Template Language).

    Note: DTL allows you to use logic like {% if %} or {% for %} directly inside your HTML.
